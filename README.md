# Instructions
Those are my dotfile, wrote for my personal use. Use at your own risk (:

## Script
To use just run the `create_symlinks.sh` and add a line with `source alias.sh` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

TODO:
- To make the install script more efficient:
    - To create the folder for .config/nvim if non existing.
    - To create a Makefile with the install Makefile
- Make that README better.
- Install Lazy.nvim
